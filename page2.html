                <h1>Ravan Mammadov (Team Leader)</h1>
                <p class="info1">"Hello, my name is Mammadov Ravan. I am 18 years old and I live in Sumgayit. I graduated from Yusif Memmedeliyev High School No. 31 in 2020 and am currently studying Computer Engineering at ADA University. I have been studying at ADA University for 2 years now. As you know, all classes at ADA University are taught in English. When I entered ADA University, I had to study foundation at EAPP for 1 year because I didn't know English, and I was able to pass EAPP with success. I am currently studying as a first-year student in my specialty. When I was at EAPP, I had doubts about whether I would be able to graduate from this university because the lessons were very difficult for meand before entering the university, everyone said that it was difficult to study at ADA. But over time, I saw that everything was getting better, and the lessons were no longer as difficult as before. A big part of my recovery was the support of my family. Another reason was future career opportunities, a beautiful campus and a very positive atmosphere, and I am very happy that I studied at ADA University."</p>

                <p class="info1">"My name is Abdullah Bayramov, and I am 18 years old. I live in Sumgayit and I graduated from Sumgayit high school number 36. It is my second year at ADA University, and my major is Computer Engineering. In my first year, I studied in the EAPP program. I did some research before choosing ADA University and decided that this university was the best. I am confident that I will have a perfect student life at ADA University and receive higher education. The reason I chose SITE faculty is because of my interest in computers since my childhood. I had my first computer when I was 10, and since then I have enjoyed working on a computer. Also, my interest in programming is one of the main factors that played a role in choosing this faculty. Moreover, in the early days of university, I had a challenging adaptation period, but as time went on, I got used to it and began to study better. I hope I will graduate from the university with a high GPA."</p>

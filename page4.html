                <p class="information">Preparation for Hour of Code event- We had to choose one school and at least 20 participants from that school to implement the Hour of Code project. Therefore, first of all, each of us contacted the school we graduated from, and school No. 31, where Ravan Mammadov graduated, allowed us to conduct the hour of code event. The event will be held online on any day between December 6 to 12 and there will be students who are interested in algorithms and coding. We will start the Hour of Code event by first giving information about ADA University and then briefly about the algorithms. Finally, we will try to solve the problems at code.org with students. At the end of the event, the students will be provided with a certificate.</p>
